//Even or Odd
//Write a program that asks the user to enter a number and displays whether entered number is an odd number or even number.

//Discount and Revenue
//Revenue can be calculated as the selling price of the product times the quantity sold, i.e. revenue = price Ã— quantity.
// Write a program that asks the user to enter product price and quantity and then calculate the revenue.
// If the revenue is more than 5000 a discount is 10% offered. Program should display the discount and net revenue.
